#  The goal of this script is to get an overview of the accidents in partnership in California
#to study Domestic Violentce data set. That is how many accidents happened by year, 
#how much with weapons and without weapons, and how this dinamic was chanes during 2005-2014
#I have used the file dv_data_set_2005-2014.csv, which I found online and its open for 
#working with and develop any researchand analysis.

#I found it interesting that the accident with weapon getting less with time. 
#But apperently it is possible for

#I also tried to understand  and make move visual plots easy to understand where 
#in what country accidents happened more and predict some forecast. This code 
#in proggess and i still working on it. 
#If I made mistakes, let me know!
